<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
 language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
 browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
 It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
 web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
 and originally included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With
 HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
 forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides
 a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes,
 and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written 
using angle brackets.</p>
